# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



### Note

This is a Movie application made by React. Not a player but we can see our latest favourites movies in the page.

##### Some Key Features on this application

- This is made by Tailwind CSS.
- Movies which we will chose as favourites will be saved into the local-storage.
- Movies can be filtered out based on genre, search etc.
- Favourite movies can be sort by Popularity and Rating both in  ascending order or descending order.
